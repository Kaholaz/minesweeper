# Minesweeper
This is a simple implementation of the Minesweeper game. The implementation can be played at (my website.)[https://kaholaz.ddns.net/minesweeper]

# How to run locally
To run locally, one would need to compile the typscript files to javascript files. This can be done with the typescript compiler. Once this program has been installed, run `tsc` in the root folder. The game can now be played by viewing the index.html file in a web browser.
